## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using Grid was the important part in this project.

Grid property can solve the complex pattern in easily way. So I recommend for the people if you are trying to complete the project then use the "Grid" property.

### Continued development

I do want to focus on grid property as I understood that we can solve difficult pattern easily with grid property and make responsive in different width of the device.

So I hope and I will focus on grid as well as on other properties to make the website more responsive.
